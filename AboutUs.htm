         <h2>History</h2>
            <p>EspressYourself Cafe is a locally owned and started by John Nguyen and Dominic Rosswick. They were sick of the coffee being served in the college they were attending.
               So they dreamt of opening a coffee shop for many years until one day it came into fruition.
               Their dream is to provide a friendly, inviting and comfortable environment for anyone seeking a place to grab a cup on their way to work each day, sit and relax with a good friend or book, or even hold a business meeting. 
               Their goal is to serve each an every customer with the friendliness of your best friend!</p>

         <h2>Philanthropy</h2>
            <p>One of the cafe's missions has always been to give back to the community and back to the farmers who grow the beans we use. 
               That's why EspressYourself Cafe has teamed up the <a href="https://www.thecoffeetrust.org/"> The Coffee Trust</a> foundation, whose work is to help indigenous coffee farmers
               improve their agriculural practices, diversift their incomes, and raise healthy families. </p>
            <p>If you wish to donate to them directly here is their <a href="https://www.thecoffeetrust.org/donate">link</a>.</p>
